reldred's Basic Stations

This set was never released publicly, but now for the first time ever bear witness to the Basic Stations Set!

To be honest with the rework of the Rural Stations slated to happen I'm probably going to wrap up this set into the Rural Stations as I really don't have a lot to offer people with that set's rework beyond some minor spit and polish. And to be honest, Rural Stations was just Suburban Stations with a reskin, I want to make this one more of its own thing for small little train stations that don't really warrant any facilities.
